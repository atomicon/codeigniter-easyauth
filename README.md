codeigniter-easyauth
====================

Very basic and "need-to-know" authentication package.

This package is very basic and focuses on 1 thing only: authentication

Easyauth is very configurable.

How to use:

- Run the SQL file (it is in the folder 'sql')
- Copy the Auth.php from controllers to your application/controllers folder
- Copy the folder 'easyauth' from views to your application/views folder

Thats it. (you can login with: *admin@admin.com* and *password*)

*note*
It isn't mandatory that you call your database table 'users' you can change that if you like.
The same for your controller... a simple find & replace on 'Auth' 'auth' will do.
